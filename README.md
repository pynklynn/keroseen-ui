# Keroseen UI
Sass framework of minimal mixins to use as a blueprint to create a custom user interface without the bloat.

This framework intentionally comes with no compiled visible assets. In fact, if a developer attempts to use the framework as is, little to no usable CSS will be generated. The framework is designed as mixins to be included as parts of other classes to generate a framework.

The mixins provide basic sizing and positioning defaults for elements or groups of elements on a page. Aside from the bare minimum, no other stylings are included.
