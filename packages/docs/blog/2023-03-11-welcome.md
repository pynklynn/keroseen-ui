Welcome to the revamp of the Keroseen UI library building toward the 1.0 release.
Since starting Keroseen several years ago, the world of web development has changed dramatically.
With that, I decided it was time to revamp this library to make it even easier for everyone to use.

Some ideas for the future:

- CSS custom properties
- Custom properties that are defined for easy styling
- Web components

None of these are set in stone as definite features coming, but just things I'm considering adding.
